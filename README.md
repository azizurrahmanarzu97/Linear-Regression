# Linear Regression Model — Predicting Y from X (with Plot)
# This project demonstrates how to build a simple Linear Regression model that learns the relationship between X and Y — and visualizes it with a scatter plot and regression line. It’s a clean beginner-friendly example of how machine learning actually looks when applied.

# Features:
# User inputs X and Y data points
# Builds a linear regression model using scikit-learn
# Shows the regression equation
# Predicts Y for any new X value
# Plots data points and regression line
# Easy to understand for students and beginners

# Visualization:
# After the model is trained, the program generates a plot showing:
# Blue dots → Original data points
# Red line → Best-fit regression line
